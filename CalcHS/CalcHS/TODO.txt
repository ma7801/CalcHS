TODO:
-Disable keyboard popping up when clicking input (intercept event of some sort?)
   - Need to have custom renderers for Android and IOS.  See: https://theconfuzedsourcecode.wordpress.com/2017/05/19/a-keyboard-disabled-entry-control-in-xamarin-forms/
- Fix exponent button - in NCalc, a "^" means bitwise OR; need to use "pow()" function instead 
- Probably will need to implement "states" to communicate what mode the calculator is in and to take actions based on the state (i.e. answer was just given,
  table mode, stat mode, etc.);

Feautres to do next:
- settings (color theme, mainly)
- Table
 


Down the road Features:
- Stats (1 var, 2 var)
- Probability functions
